TIPER aims to automatically generate
Type Inference Prototyping Engine from Relational specifications of
type systems. Our goal is to build a practical framework called TIPER
that automates type system implementations just as parser implementations are
automated by parser generators, ever since Yacc was developed in the 70's.
Such a framework will reduce the high-cost of type system implementations supporting
type inference so that advancements in type systems research would become much
more available to the developers as a cost-effective technology to support in
a language implementation. You may take a look at
the [talk slides on TIPER](https://slides.com/kyagrd/rowpoly-coalpty16) if you are
interested in further details.

In our preliminary case study, we have demonstrated that Logic Programming (LP) is suitable for declarative & executable specifications of polymorphic type systems including advanced features such as type-constructor polymorphism (a.k.a. higher-kinded polymorphism) and kind polymorphism, in addition to type polymorphism in the Hindley--Milner type system (HM). Because our specification is _relational_, rather than functional, we were able to specify both type checking and type inference without duplication. Being based on LP, our specification is _excutable_ on a machine. Executable specifications reduce the gap between a specification and an implementation. Our specification is not only executable for testing the result of type checking but also serves as a reference implementation for a type inference engine, because the specification can run both ways bidirectionally as a logic program.

## Proof-of-Concept Interactive Examples
Here are some examples from [our FLOPS 2016 paper](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/557756cfdfb75ebd54bf5807) made
accessible (and also refined, more celaned up than the code in the paper) via online SWI-Prolog environments. You can do simple experiments within these webpages, without installing SWI-Prolog on your local system.

## Future Plans
* Error handling and parser integration.
* Support more features
  - term indices (as in Nax)
  - first class polymorphism and modules
  - Generalized Algebraic Data Type(GADT)s
  - qualified types such as type classes
  - null-handling (as in Kotlin)
  - measures of unit
  - ... (and maybe more including OO-related features) ...
* Research/case-study on alternative LP semantics including S-resolution, which may be better suited for type checking/inference.
* Implementation based on an embedded DSL for LP such as micro-Kanren. (This will lift the dependency on SWI-Prolog and make TIPER possible directly target many other languages where Kanren has already been implemented.)
* Plug-ins for IDEs and scriptable editors, which are do neccesarily depend on a specific compiler/interpreter implementation.  This will be possible at a stage when we produce a mature (easy-to-use & portalbe) version of TIPER.
